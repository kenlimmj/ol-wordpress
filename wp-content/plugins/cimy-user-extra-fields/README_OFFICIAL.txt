Cimy User Extra Fields

WordPress is becoming more than ever a tool to open blog/websites and CMSs in an easier way. Users are increasing day by day; one of the limits however is the restricted and predefined fields that are available in the registered users profile: it is difficult for example to ask for the acceptance of "Terms and Conditions of Use" or "Permission to use personal data".
It's also possible to set a password during registration combined to equalTO rule, only people who knows the password can register.

We have developed a WordPress plug-in to do this.

There are some plug-ins that do something similar, but this one wants to focus on giving the administrator the possibility to add all fields needed, on the rules that can be defined for each field, and in giving the possibility to both administration and the user to change the data inserted.

As for now the plug-in supports:
 * text
 * textarea
 * textarea-rich
 * password
 * checkbox
 * radio
 * dropdown
 * dropdown-multi
 * picture
 * picture-url
 * registration-date
 * avatar
 * file

future versions can have more.

Following WordPress hidden fields can be enabled during registration:
 * password
 * first name
 * last name
 * nickname
 * website
 * Aim
 * Yahoo IM
 * Jabber/Google Talk
 * biographical info

Other features:
 * reCAPTCHA
 * image upload with crop/resize functions
 * custom welcome email (non MS installations)
 * custom registration logo (non MS installations)
 * email confirmation (non MS installations)
 * form confirmation (non MS installations)
 * much more!

The plug-in adds two new menu voices in the admin for the administrator and two for users.

Two new menus are:

WordPress and WordPress MultiSite per-blog registration:
    1. "Users -> Users Extended" - lets you show users lists with the new fields that are created
    2. "Settings -> Cimy User Extra Fields" - lets administrators add as many new fields as are needed to the users' profile, giving the possibility to set some interesting rules.

Wordpress MultiSite unique registration:
    1. "Network Admin -> Users Extended" - lets you show users lists with the new fields that are created
    2. "Network Admin -> Cimy User Extra Fields" - lets administrators add as many new fields as are needed to the users' profile, giving the possibility to set some interesting rules.

Rules are:

    * min/exact/max length admitted
	[only for text, textarea, textarea-rich, password, picture, picture-url, avatar, file]

    * field can be empty
	[only for text, textarea, textarea-rich, password, picture, picture-url, dropdown, dropdown-multi, avatar, file]

    * check for e-mail address syntax
	[only for text, textarea, textarea-rich, password]

    * field can be modified after the registration
	[only for text, textarea, textarea-rich, password, picture, picture-url, checkbox, radio, dropdown, dropdown-multi, avatar, file]
	[for radio and checkbox 'edit_only_if_empty' has no effects and 'edit_only_by_admin_or_if_empty' has the same effect as edit_only_by_admin]

    * field equal to some value (for example accept terms and conditions)
	[all except avatar by default set to 512]

      * equal to can be or not case sensitive
	[only for text, textarea, textarea-rich, password, dropdown, dropdown-multi]

Visualization rules
    * field can be hidden during registration
	[all]

    * field can be hidden in user's profile
	[all]

    * field can be hidden in Users Extended page
	[all]

    * field can be hidden in Search Engine (only if you installed the template)
	[all]

    * field can be hidden in Blog's public page (only if you installed the template)
	[all]

    * all visualization rules can be overridden if an user has certain rights (default=no override)
	[all]

New fields will be visible everywhere by default, a part some WordPress fields.


BEFORE writing to me read carefully ALL the documentation AND the FAQ. Missing this step means you are wasting my time!
Bugs or suggestions can be mailed at: cimmino.marco@gmail.com

REQUIREMENTS:
 * PHP >= 5.0.0
 * WORDPRESS >= 3.1.x
 * WORDPRESS MultiSite >= 3.1.x
 * MYSQL >= 4.1.2

INSTALLATION:
- WordPress: just copy whole cimy-user-extra-fields subdir into your plug-in directory and activate it

- WordPress MultiSite:
There are two supported ways of using this plug-in under WordPress MultiSite:

1) Unique registration
If you want that ALL Blogs on your MultiSite installation follow the same registration with the same fields this is the case for you.
Every blog will have shared registration page and only the Super Admin can change it.
 - unpack the package under 'wp-content/mu-plugins' directory (if this directory does not exist, create it);
 - be sure that cimy_user_extra_fields.php is outside Cimy folder (move it if necessary);
 - go to "Network Admin -> Cimy User Extra Fields", press "Fix the problem" button and confirm.

2) Per-Blog registration
If you want that every single Blog can define its own Extra Fields then you should choose this installation.
Every registration will have Extra Fields defined by single blogs, every user will have anyway WordPress fields shared with ALL Blogs, this how it works WordPress MultiSite.
 - unpack the package under 'wp-content/plugins' directory;
 - be sure that cimy_uef_mu_activation.php is installed under 'wp-content/mu-plugins' directory (if this directory does not exist, create it);
 - then every single blog will have it under "Plugins" section.


UPDATE FROM A PREVIOUS VERSION:
- visit Cimy User Extra Fields admin options, DB upgrade will be performed automatically


HOW TO ASSIGN A DEFAULT VALUE TO THE EXTRA FIELDS:
1. You can assign a default value using the VALUE textarea in the admin panel.
2. You can use URL (only for registration page), example:
http://www.exampleofmywebsite.it/wordpress29/wp-login.php?action=register&FIELD_01=test1&FIELD_02=test2

FIELD_01 and FIELD_02 are two existing fields that will get default assignment with string "test1" and "test2".
Note 1: Field name should be upper case otherwise won't be recognized.
Note 2: These two methods can be used together, but remember that URL has higher priority.


FUNCTIONS USEFUL FOR YOUR THEMES OR TEMPLATES:

[Function get_cimyFieldValue]
NOTE: password fields values will not be returned for security reasons

USAGE:
$value = get_cimyFieldValue($user_id, $field_name, [$field_value]);

In ALL cases if an error is occured or there are no matching results from the call then NULL is returned.


This function is all you need to retrieve extra fields values, but in order to retrieve all power from it you have to understand all different ways that can be used.


CASE 1:
get an extra field value from a specific user

PARAMETERS: pass user_id as first parameter and field_name as second
RETURNED VALUE: the function will return a string containing the value

GENERIC:
	$value = get_cimyFieldValue(<user_id>, <field_name>);
EXAMPLE:
	$value = get_cimyFieldValue(1, 'MY_FIELD');
	echo cimy_uef_sanitize_content($value);


CASE 2:
get all extra fields values from a specific user

PARAMETERS: pass user_id as first parameter and a boolean set to false as second
RETURNED VALUE: the function will return an associative array containing all extra fields values from that user, this array is ordered by field order

GENERIC:
	$values = get_cimyFieldValue(<user_id>, false);
EXAMPLE:
	$values = get_cimyFieldValue(1, false);

	foreach ($values as $value) {
		echo $value['NAME'];
		echo $value['LABEL'];
		echo cimy_uef_sanitize_content($value['VALUE']);
	}


CASE 3:
get value from a specific extra field and from all users

PARAMETERS: pass a boolean set to false as first parameter and field_name as second
RETURNED VALUE: the function will return an associative array containing the specific extra field value from all users, this array is ordered by user login

GENERIC:
	$values = get_cimyFieldValue(false, <field_name>);
EXAMPLE:
	$values = get_cimyFieldValue(false, 'MY_FIELD');

	foreach ($values as $value) {
		$user_id = $value['user_id'];
		echo $value['user_login'];
		echo cimy_uef_sanitize_content($value['VALUE']);
	}


CASE 4a:
get all users that have a specific value in a specific extra field

PARAMETERS: pass a boolean set to false as first parameter, field_name as second and field_value as third
RETURNED VALUE: the function will return an associative array containing all users that has that value in that specific extra field, this array is ordered first by user login

GENERIC:
	$values = get_cimyFieldValue(false, <field_name>, <field_value>);
EXAMPLE:
	$values = get_cimyFieldValue(false, 'COLOR', 'red');

	foreach ($values as $value) {
		$user_id = $value['user_id'];
		echo $value['user_login'];
	}


CASE 4b:
get all users that contains (also partially) a specific value in a specific extra field

PARAMETERS: pass a boolean set to false as first parameter, field_name as second and a special array as third
RETURNED VALUE: the function will return an associative array containing all users that contains (also partially) that value in that specific extra field, this array is ordered by user login

GENERIC:
	$values = get_cimyFieldValue(false, <field_name>, <array>);
EXAMPLE:
	$field_value = array();
	$field_value['value'] = ".com";
	$field_value['like'] = true;

	$values = get_cimyFieldValue(false, 'WEBSITE', $field_value);

	foreach ($values as $value) {
		$user_id = $value['user_id'];
		echo $value['user_login'];
	}


CASE 5:
get all users with all values

PARAMETERS: pass two boolean set to false as first and second parameter
RETURNED VALUE: the function will return an associative array containing all extra fields values for every user, this array is ordered first by user login and second by field order

GENERIC:
	$values = get_cimyFieldValue(false, false);
EXAMPLE:
	$values = get_cimyFieldValue(false, false);
	$old_name = "";

	foreach ($values as $value) {
		$user_id = $value['user_id'];
		$new_name = $value['user_login'];

		if ($old_name != $new_name)
			echo "<br /><br />".$new_name."<br /><br />";

		echo $value['LABEL'].": ";
		echo cimy_uef_sanitize_content($value['VALUE'])."<br />";

		$old_name = $new_name;
	}


ADDITIONAL EXAMPLES:
This is an example how to retrieve and display one uploaded image of the current user logged in.

$user = wp_get_current_user();

// is there someone logged?
if ($user->ID) {
	$value = cimy_uef_sanitize_content(get_cimyFieldValue($user->ID, 'IMAGE'));
	echo '<img src="'.$value.'" alt="description_here" />';
}


This is an entire example that can be used into your theme for example to retrieve the value from SITE extra field that of course was created.
If you put the example just inside an existing loop you shouldn't add it again, just use get_cimyFieldValue call and echo call.

if (have_posts()) {
	while (have_posts()) {
		the_post();

		$value = get_cimyFieldValue(get_the_author_ID(), 'SITE');

		if ($value != NULL)
			echo cimy_uef_sanitize_content($value);
	}
}


If you experience duplicate printing this is due to the loop and where/how it is used; to avoid this you can use this code that has a little workaround.
REMEMBER: you cannot use get_the_author_ID() outside the loop, this because WordPress doesn't permit this.

if (have_posts()) {
	$flag = true;

	while (have_posts()) {
		the_post();

		if ($flag) {
			$value = get_cimyFieldValue(get_the_author_ID(), 'SITE');

			if ($value != NULL)
				echo cimy_uef_sanitize_content($value);

			$flag = false;
		}
	}
}


PICTURE AND get_cimyFieldValue FUNCTION:

If you want to display the image in an HTML page just use IMG object like this:
<img src="<?php echo $image_url; ?>" alt="description_here" />


If you want to get the thumbnail url and you have only the image url you can use this function:
$thumb_url = cimy_get_thumb_path($image_url);


REGISTRATION-DATE AND get_cimyFieldValue FUNCTION:

Remember that the function returns the timestamp so to have the correct date printed you can use this function:
echo cimy_get_formatted_date($value);

or

echo cimy_get_formatted_date($value, $format);

where $format is the date and time format, more tags details here:
http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.strftime.php


[Function set_cimyFieldValue]
NOTE 1: the user should have permission to write the value: this mean if the function is used when no user is logged in will always fail.
NOTE 2: for checkbox fields use field_value=true/false to check/uncheck
NOTE 3: for radio fields use field_value equal to the label you want to select
NOTE 4: for dropdown fields use field_value equal to the item in the label you want to select
NOTE 5: for dropdown-multi fields use field_value equal to the items in the label you want to select separated by a comma: ','

USAGE:
$result = set_cimyFieldValue($user_id, $field_name, $field_value);

RETURNED VALUE:
An array is returned with all user ids where the change has been successful; empty array in case of error or the value is already in the DB.


CASE 1:
set an extra field value for a specific user

PARAMETERS: pass user_id as first parameter, field_name as second and field_value as third
RETURNED VALUE: the function will return an array containing USER_ID=1 if 'NEW_VALUE' has been written into 'MY_FIELD'

GENERIC:
	$result = set_cimyFieldValue(<user_id>, <field_name>, <field_value>);
EXAMPLE:
	$result = set_cimyFieldValue(1, 'MY_FIELD', 'NEW_VALUE');


CASE 2:
set an extra field value for all users

PARAMETERS: pass false as first parameter, field_name as second and field_value as third
RETURNED VALUE: the function will return an array containing all USER_IDs where 'NEW_VALUE' has been written into 'MY_FIELD'

GENERIC:
	$result = set_cimyFieldValue(false, <field_name>, <field_value>);
EXAMPLE:
	$result = set_cimyFieldValue(false, 'MY_FIELD', 'NEW_VALUE');


[Function cimy_uef_sanitize_content]
This function protects your blog from users trying to add JavaScript or alter your blog doing HTML injection in extra fields. It is very important that you do not remove that function.
This function filters only some html tags and let other be used, the list of tags that are allowed is present under /wp-includes/kses.php search for $allowedtags array definition.

It can accepts two parameters:
$content: the content to be protected against HTML injections
$override_allowed_tags [array|null, default null]: if you want to override allowed tags you should pass a proper array where all your favourite tags are listed.

USAGE:
echo cimy_uef_sanitize_content($content, [$override_allowed_tags]);

EXAMPLE:
global $allowedtags;

// copy the array to not modify the original one
$my_tags = $allowedtags;

// add img tag to allowed tags list
$my_tags["img"] = array(
	"src" => array(),
	"alt => array(),
);

// $content is what I want to show, see previous examples for more details
echo cimy_uef_sanitize_content($content, $my_tags);


[Function get_cimyFields]
This function returns an array containing all extra fields defined by the admin ordered by the order defined in the admin page, if there are no fields an empty array is returned.

It can accepts two parameters:
$wp_fields [true|false, default false]: if true will return hidden WordPress fields enabled
$order_by_section [true|false, default false]: if true array returned will be ordered as first key by fieldset and as second key by order; this parameter can be applied only if the first one is set to false.

USAGE:
$allFields = get_cimyFields([$wp_fields], [$order_by_section]);

EXAMPLE:
$allFields = get_cimyFields();

if (count($allFields) > 0) {
	foreach ($allFields as $field) {
		echo "ID: ".$field['ID']." \n";
		echo "F_ORDER: ".$field['F_ORDER']." \n";
		echo "NAME: ".$field['NAME']." \n";
		echo "TYPE: ".$field['TYPE']." \n";
		echo "VALUE: ".$field['VALUE']." \n";
		echo "LABEL: ".$field['LABEL']." \n";
		echo "DESCRIPTION: ".$field['DESCRIPTION']." \n";

		echo "RULES: ";
		print_r($field['RULES']);
		echo "\n\n";
	}
}

HOW TO CHANGE REGISTRATION DATE FORMAT:
You can change the format of the registration date putting your own format in equal to rule using tags from strftime php function:
http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.strftime.php

default used if not specified:
%d %B %Y @%H:%M

Month and weekday names and other language dependent strings respect the current locale set in your WordPress installation.


HOW TO USE PICTURE SUPPORT:
You have two possibilities for user picture support: "picture-url" and "picture"

[PICTURE-URL]
User will provide only a link and the image will be linked from that site, it will NOT be copied into the server

[PICTURE]
User will upload the image that is stored into his/her computer and the image will be copied into the server

First of all you need a directory where all pictures will be stored, the directory MUST HAVE this name: 'Cimy_User_Extra_Fields' and MUST BE placed under: "wp-content" dir
example: /wp-content/Cimy_User_Extra_Fields directory and give it 777 permissions if you are under Linux (or 770 and group to "www-data" if you are under Ubuntu Linux).

HOW TO USE AVATAR SUPPORT:
Create the same directory needed for PICTURE support, avatars will be stored in a subdirectory and will not interfere with other pictures uploaded by the same plug-in


ADVANCED OPTIONS:
Advanced options have been introduced in v2.1.0 to accommodate some extra options per field.
Multiple options should be comma separated ','

[AVATAR, PICTURE]
no-thumb=1 - do not crate the thumbnail (if equalTO rule is set it will resize the original image)
crop_ratio=4:3 - fix cropping ratio
crop_x1=0,crop_y1=0,crop_x2=80,crop_y2=90 - pre-select cropping window

[AVATAR, PICTURE, FILE]
filename=default.pdf - rename the uploaded file to the given file name


KNOWN ISSUES:
- if you add too many fields in the "Users Extended" menu they will go out of frame
- some rules are never applied if you are using PHP 4.x please update to PHP 5.x as stated in the REQUIREMENTS
- registration date cannot be modified
- picture and avatar upload is disabled during registration under WordPress MultiSite, will be possible once user is activated
- if you change order or remove fieldsets you may need to set all extra fields' fieldset assigment again
- dropdown issues:
  - custom value is not supported
  - comma is not allowed as it is the delimiter
- registration confirmation does not work if you use Theme My Login plug-in


FAQ:
Q: When will be supported mandatory accept of terms and conditions field?

A: Has been always there: is as easy as adding a checkbox and setting "equal to" rule to YES.


Q: What the Database options do exactly?

A: Basically you can:
- empty or drop extra fields or extra fields data (inserted by users)
- reset or drop plug-in's options


Q: Yes but will this affect other data? It says "WordPress Fields table", this is scary.

A: No, it will affect _only_ the data produced by the plug-in. Really.
Also keep in mind that if you do NOT have to restore default values or uninstall the plug-in, then you do not need to touch them.


Q: Cimy User Extra Fields is not compatible with "Themed Login", how can I do?

A: The reality is this plug-in IS compatible with WordPress 2.1 or greater and "Themed Login" NOT, so it's NOT a Cimy User Extra Field's bug! However I have tried with a little success a workaround to make it works, but first please understand that this is totally untested and unsupported hack, if you want a better one ask the author of that plug-in to support new WordPress!
If you still want *my* personal and unsupported hack edit the plug-in "Themed Login" and do these 3 modifications:

1) at line 773, after "global $wpdb, $wp_query;" add this:
global $errors;

2) at line 811, before "if ( 0 == count($errors) ) {" add this:
do_action('register_post');

3) at line 871, before "A password will be emailed to you." add this:
<?php do_action('register_form'); ?>


Q1: I got "Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 8388608 bytes exhausted [..]", why?
Q2: I got blank pages after activating this plug-in, why?

A1: Because your memory limit is too low, to fix it edit your php.ini and search memory_limit key and put at least to 12M
A2: If you do not have access to your php.ini you can try this workaround (might not work)
http://codex.wordpress.org/Editing_wp-config.php#Increasing_memory_allocated_to_PHP


Q: Your plug-in is great, but when you will add support to add more than one choice in radio and dropdown fields?

A: This feature is here since ages, for radio field just use the same name, for dropdown field read instructions in the add field area (in the plug-in).


Q: Uploaded images are not resized, why?

A: You should add php-gd module (under Ubuntu install php5-gd package).


Q: Why big files are not being uploaded?

A: Please check this website, tells you how to change your PHP configurations to fix this issue: http://www.radinks.com/upload/config.php


Q: Why admin user cannot see all fields even if I set to do it?

A: Probably you installed the first time WordPress on PHP4 and you experienced this bug: http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/8317
To fix the problem you need to create another administrator user and change admin user to another role and then back to administrator.


Q1: I'm using your plug-in on WordPress MultiSite per-blog installation and when I register one user all Extra Fields are ignored, why?
Q2: I get this error: 'Fatal error: Call to undefined function cimy_uef_mu_blog_exists()', why?

A: Because you missed to move cimy_uef_mu_activation.php file please check carefully the installation steps.


Q: I'm using your plug-in on WordPress MultiSite per-blog installation, I'm registering users on one blog but they appear on the main blog too, why?

A: Because WordPress MS is designed like that and I can't do anything about, however all extra fields and relative data are saved per-blog.
Since I had already a long discussion with an user that didn't believe this, don't bother me to insist on this topic until you prove I'm wrong.


Q: I’m trying to use a regular expression in the rules, but the check does not work as expected, why?

A: Usually means your regex is wrong, please study how to properly build it: http://php.net/manual/en/function.preg-match.php


Q1: I do not see Extra Fields under the page user-new.php can you add there too?
Q2: How can I import new users with Extra Fields data into?

A: Unluckily due to a WordPress limitation I can’t add Extra Fields into user-new.php but you can quickly add all the users you want using my plugin:
Cimy User Manager – http://www.marcocimmino.net/cimy-wordpress-plugins/cimy-user-manager/


Q: I cannot edit neither delete some Extra Fields, usually after the 10th one, why?

A: Your PHP server is probably limiting number of $_POST elements, Suhosin for example does it. Please allow at least 500 or more vars.
http://www.hardened-php.net/suhosin/configuration.html#suhosin.post.max_vars


Q: I am trying to change the fields' order, but whatever I try it doesn't work, why?

A: First of all you need to select at least 2 fields if you want to change the order.
Secondly if you change for example field n.1 to position n.3 be sure that field n.3 goes into another position and finally that a field goes into position n.1
In short: every field should have a new position or at least the same one, but no positions can be skipped or be present multiple times.


Q: When feature XYZ will be added?

A: I don't know, remember that this is a 100% free project so answer is "When I have time and/or when someone help me with a donation".


Q: Can I help with a donation?

A: Sure, visit the donation page or contact me via e-mail.


Q: Can I hack this plug-in and hope to see my code in the next release?

A: For sure, this is just happened and can happen again if you write useful new features and good code. Try to see how I maintain the code and try to do the same (or even better of course), I have rules on how I write it, don't want "spaghetti code", I'm Italian and I want spaghetti only on my plate.
There is no guarantee that your patch will hit an official upcoming release of the plug-in, but feel free to do a fork of this project and distribute it, this is GPL!


Q1: I have found a bug what can I do?
Q2: Something does not work as expected, why?

A: The first thing is to download the latest version of the plug-in and see if you still have the same issue.
If yes please write me an email or write a comment but give as more details as you can, like:
- Plug-in version
- WordPress version
- MYSQL version
- PHP version
- exact error that is returned (if any)

after describe what you did, what you expected and what instead the plug-in did :)
Then the MOST important thing is: DO NOT DISAPPEAR!
A lot of times I cannot reproduce the problem and I need more details, so if you don't check my answer then 80% of the times bug (if any) will NOT BE FIXED!
